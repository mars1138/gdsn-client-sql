# GDSN Client SQL

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This project is a facsimile of a Content Management app for a Global Data Syncrhonization Network (GDSN). The main purpose is to allow a business to maintain a catalog of product data. Users register/signin, and can start registering products via the Products page. Products can then be published to prospective customers that then require the product data.

## Libraries used

React Redux for local state (user login, user products retreived from backend)
React Router for managing routes
React-Table for displaying lists of products that belong to user

## Cloud Services used by backend server

Render.com is used to host the backend server and Postgres SQL database (User accounts, products, contact requests)
Amazon S3 is used to host product images
